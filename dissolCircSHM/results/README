The movies show the dissolution of a circular chip, comparing results
with different grids.

compareBlockMEsh.ogv: compares the coarse snappyHexMesh grid
    with a blockMesh grid (80400 cells).
compareResolution.ogv: compares a coarse snappyHexMesh grid
    (49224 cells) with a fine snappyHexMesh grid (147219 cells).
compareResolution.ogv: compares Uy field for coarse and fine
    snappyHexMesh grids. The oscillations in the coarse grid
    disappear at the higher resolution. They do not affect the
    dissolution because they are outside the concentration
    boundary layer.

Preliminary tests of the mesh are in the grids directory.

The current system/box.blockMeshDict corresponds to the coarse grid.
