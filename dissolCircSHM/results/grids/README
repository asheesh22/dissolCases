Comparing fields from different meshes:
    top left:     blockMesh             80400 cells
    top right:    snappyHexMesh coarse  46922 cells
    bottom left:  snappyHexMesh fine   156977 cells
    bottom right: snappyHexMesh fine with additional layers 231496 cells

The grids give similar fields for the initial (circular shape) with
some minor errors:

1) blockMesh gives errors in the flow along the diagonal directions.
    See compareXY.png (top left to bottom right).
    This is due to the skewed elements along the diagonals.
2) snappyHexMesh has small oscillations in the flow field where the
    different levels of refinement join. Need some more work on mesh
    refinement.
3) snappyHexMesh has overresolved meshes. Use cells more efficiently.

The current snappyHexMeshDict is a modified version of the coarse grid
with 49224 cells.
